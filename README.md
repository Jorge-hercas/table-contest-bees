# table-contest-bees
For this application, the tidytuesday bee dataset was used, with the intention of knowing the life periods of the bees, their seasons with the highest number of hives, the states in which we have the most number, etc., as well as those chemicals that they are more lethal to bees than others. The main idea is that the user can interact and filter this data at will, since everything is connected to each other.

Demo of the app:
